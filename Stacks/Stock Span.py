--------------------------------------------  Stock Span  ------------------------------------------------

The span si of a stockâ€™s price on a certain day i is the minimum number of consecutive days (up to the 
current day) the price of the stock has been less than its price on that ith day. If for a particular day, 
f no stock price is greater then just count the number of days till 0th day including current day.

For eg. if given price array is {3, 6, 8, 1, 2}, span for 4th day (which has price 2) is 2 because minimum 
count of consecutive days (including 4th day itself) from current day which has price less than 4th day is 
2 (i.e. day 3 & 4). Similarly, span for 2nd day is 3 because no stock price in left is greater than 2nd 
day's price. So count is 3 till 0th day.

Given an input array with all stock prices, you need to return the array with corresponding spans of each 
day.

Note : 
    Try doing it in O(n).

#### Input format :
    Line 1 : Integer n, Arrays Size
    Line 2 : Price for n days (separated by space). It can contain duplicate values`
#### Output format :
    Return an array that contain span for each day

#### Constraints:
    Time Limit: 1 second
    Size of input array lies in the range: [1, 1000000]

#### Sample Input 1 :
    8
    60 70 80 100 90 75 80 120
#### Sample Output 1 :
    1 2 3 4 1 1 2 8

#### Sample Input 2 :
    4
    1 1 1 1
#### Sample Output 2 :
    1 1 1 1
